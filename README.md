--- MorseCode Keyboard ---

![App demo](https://github.com/horjarobert/MorseCodeKeyboard/blob/master/morseCodeKeyboard.gif)

# 1.Intro #
    
-One of my first projects (real project) in Python is this. Here you have a nice keyboard layout with a display which shows you the request letter in Morse code.  
***

# 2.Description #
    
-This project was put to life with 'tkinter' library;  
-'tkinter' library is easy to use, has an incredible power for UI/UX design;  
***

# 3.Tips #

-After every word, click 'New word' to separate the words for a better understanding;  
-Maybe you don't want to use 'New word' to appear on screen '///' , therefore you can use 'Space' to put spaces between your letters (your choice is my law);  
-Use 'CLEAR' button to clean the display...  
-Notice that '@', '#', '%', '&', '|', '*', '~',  '.', ',' and '!' are without any Morse code...  
***

# 4.Purpose #

-Main purpose of this project is that conversion from normal letter into Morse code;  
-Best utility for this app (desktop app) is to help you in a school/job project where you need to convert some letters into Morse and you have only this app (without Internet signal);  
-And last but not least, this project was for me a deep breath in Desktop App area, where I found a pliable usability of Python in day by day coding projects.
